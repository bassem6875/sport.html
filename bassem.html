<h1><mark>importance of sports</mark></h1>
<p><b>Sports is such an activity that it can be taken up by anyone; at any age and any point in <br/>
life. Adults, children and elders everyone alike can take part in sports. Many regard<br/>
 sports as a mere co-curricular or extra-curricular activity in schools. However, in reality,<br/>
 sports play an equally important role as does education in a person’s life. To achieve<br/>
 overall and all-round development in life, one should be well-versed in both sports and <br/>
culture. While training sharpens the mind, sports sharpens the body and fitness.</b> Thus,<br/>
 both are essential.</p>

<h2><mark>Sports improve your concentration</mark></h2>

<p><u>There are numerous advantages of involving oneself in sports. First and foremost, as<br/>
known by all and very definitively, competitions increase the physical fitness of an<br/>
 individual. Additionally, sports also contribute to building stable mental well-being of a<br/>
 person. Various researchers show that people who are in the daily practice of sports in <br/>
any form record better mental as well as physical health. Moreover, sports also<br/>
 eliminates the risk of a person catching diseases or facing any bodily interruptions</u>.</p><br/>
<h3><mark>Sports reduce stress and depression</mark></h3>
<p> Competitions increase immunity and increase people’s stamina.I enjoy playing all sorts <br/>
of games both indoors as well as outdoors. Among the indoor games, I enjoy playing chess.<br/> 
I also enjoy playing badminton and table tennis with my friends and cousins. But the game<br/>
 I like the most is badminton. I not only enjoy playing this game, but also love watching it.<br/>
 It is my favorite game. We play badminton in our school also. I am in our school team and I <br/>
really enjoy playing for our school. I open innings for our school team</p>.<br/>
<h3><mark>Sports help you maintain a healthy weight</mark></h3>
With little saving from my pocket money, I am saving money to get a high-quality badminton racket.<br/>
 I love to sleep beside my current racket and often get tears in my eyes when I miss a<br/>
 chance to play badminton. My training is not a professional level right now so getting <br/>
fundamental skill is a bit<br/>
 crucial for me at this stage. On the other hand, I am waiting to join my school team <br/>
of badminton and waiting for getting into the appropriate age for it.<br/>
